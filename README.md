# caffe-ssd-windows
caffe-ssd from weiliu89, I modified it for compliance with Windows. 

The environment is Windows10+VS2015+CUDA10ã€‚

I compiled following projects successfully:

1. caffe
2. caffe.bin and projects in tools dir
3. ssd_detect and projects in examples dir

But I failed to compile pycaffe project. So I can not use python in this caffe-ssd-widows.

I completed the whole ssd train-val-test  routine with this caffe-ssd-windows.
